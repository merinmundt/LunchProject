I use arrayLists to go through this entire project. I quickly realized that this would require a lot of them.
I used a bufferedReader to read from stdin. I tested my project with an input.txt file that I have now deleted
but both files ended up getting the correct output. 

I had to use the split() function to be able to parse through the input correctly. Then I took all the parts of 
of the split function and placed the following node in the corresponding ArrayList that I wanted. 

By splitting up the individual nodes and the neighbors, I was able to use indices to go to each neighbor 
separately and add them to my listOfConnections arraylist that would lead to my possible meeting points.

Then using the Arrays class, which I was happy to come across, I was able to make sure the avoidNode was 
avoided. 

I also had to make sure that cycles would not be a problem, so If I listOfConnections was empty and the current 
node was already in possible, then I just returned the arraylist possible

I learned a lot about arrayLists from this project. Using the functions get() and indexOf() were huge helps to
my project.
